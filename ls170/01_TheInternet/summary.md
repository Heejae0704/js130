# 01 The Internet - Summary

- The internet is a vast network of networks. It is comprised of both the network infrastructure itself (devices, routers, switches, cables, etc) and the protocols that enable that infrastructure to function.

- Protocols are systems of rules. Network protocols are systems of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data over a network.

- Different types of protocol are concerned with different aspects of network communication. It can be useful to think of these different protocols as operating at particular 'layers' of the network.

- Encapsulation is a means by which protocols at different network layers can work together.

- Encapsulation is implemented through the use of Protocol Data Units (PDUs). The PDU of a protocol at one layer, becomes the data payload of the PDU of a protocol at a lower layer.

- The physical network is the tangible infrastructure that transmits the electrical signals, light, and radio waves which carry network communications.

- Latency is a measure of delay. It indicates the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.

- Bandwidth is a measure of capacity. It indicates the amount of data that can be transmitted in a set period of time.

- Ethernet is a set of standards and protocols that enables communication between devices on a local network.

- Ethernet uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Frame.

- Ethernet uses MAC addressing to identify devices connected to the local network.

- The Internet Protocol (IP) is the predominant protocol used at this layer for inter-network communication.

- There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

- The Internet Protocol uses a system of addressing (IP Addressing) to direct data between one device and another across networks.

- IP uses a Protocol Data Unit called a Packet.
